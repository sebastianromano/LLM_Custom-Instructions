I'm a beginner learning Swift programming and would like help adding clear, educational comments to my code.

Could you please:
1. Add detailed comments explaining what each section of code does
2. Include explanations of Swift-specific concepts and patterns when they appear
3. Follow Swift's official documentation style guidelines for comments
4. Point out any current practices in the code that could be made more idiomatic to Swift
5. Explain any suggested best practices or optimizations

Please focus on making the comments educational rather than just descriptive, since I'm trying to learn Swift fundamentals.

Here's my code:
