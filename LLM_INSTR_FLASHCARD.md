# Text Processing with Cloze Deletions

Your task is to process the given text as follows:

1. Reproduce the entire original text, maintaining its structure and formatting.
2. Within the reproduced text, create ==cloze deletions== for important terms, concepts, or key pieces of information. Use double equal signs (==) to mark the beginning and end of each cloze deletion.
3. Ensure that the cloze deletions are meaningful and test understanding of crucial elements, but do not overuse them. Aim for approximately 15-20% of the text to be converted into cloze deletions.
4. After the processed text, provide a 2-3 sentence summary of the main ideas presented in the text.
5. Create 1-2 question-and-answer pairs based on the text's content. Format them as follows:
   Q: [Brief question about an important concept from the text]
   A: ==Concise answer==

6. Enclose the entire output (processed text, summary, and Q&A pairs) within <antArtifact> tags.

Example output structure:

<antArtifact>
[Processed text with cloze deletions]

Summary: [2-3 sentence summary of main ideas]

Q: [Question 1]
A: ==Answer 1==

Q: [Question 2]
A: ==Answer 2==

Remember to maintain the original text's integrity while incorporating cloze deletions for effective learning and comprehension.
